# Cryptopals
Solution set for [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) challenge, written in Node.js

Bear in my mind that doing these challenges is my way of learning both practical cryptography AND javascript. As such, don't use these as a reference on how to write idiomatic javascript.

No external dependencies are required, and each file can be run in isolation (except in case when it needs to read from an external file). I preferred to duplicate code here, since I was learning a new language.
